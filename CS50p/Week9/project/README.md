## DISCLAIMERS =
* No external resources were used in the making of this project
* The game looks and feels like and old school text based game, that is purely intentional, and very much nostalgic
* a ./run_python.sh was added to avoid 'invalid escape sequence' prompted by the ASCII art in the code
* a #!/usr/bin/env python3.12 was used to get rid of incompatibility issues that might occur
* that's it, enjoy!
